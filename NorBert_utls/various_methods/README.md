Folder containing various NLP methods i ulitmately decided against using.

'fintuning_example' is the native NorBERT example script. works well but has no GPU support.

'sentiment_analysis_stackabuse' is simply some code copied from stackabuse. Unsure if it works.

'roberta threelabel' is the roberta_solar_sentiment code made to work with negative, netural and postive labels. This works fine on GPU but some inherent properties of the dataset makes this not reach more than 60% accuracy.
